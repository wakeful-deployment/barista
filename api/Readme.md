* Getting Started

** Elixir

The api is written in Elixir (which is based on Erlang) and uses the Phoenix framework.

Follow the instructions to [install Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.htm) 
for your platform of choice, which should also [install Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/download.html) as well.

If you have just installed Elixir for the first time, you will need to install 
the Hex package manager as well. 

```mix local.hex```

Lastly, you can install phoenix: 

```mix archive.install https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/releases/download/v1.1.1/phoenix_new-1.1.1.ez```

(or use the [latest Phoenix version](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation)).
